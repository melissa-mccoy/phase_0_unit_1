# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	Answer: I love standards - this is where the juice is. Good.
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	Answer: The ppt said to set the body with a "specific width" and I'm assuming that means a fixed width using px or ems...but then it goes on to say that we set content at 100% width with a 1400 max, 960 min or whatever. Why wouldn't we set the body with these specs? The body element still has the html element as its parent so I don't see any issue with this. 
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	Answer: They're easier to pick out when you're scanning code versus all these divs. Though, they do seem rather pointless as they have no prescribed (pre-defined) characteristics - they're just like divs...so ya, I guess it's just faster to type and read. 
* Why is reset.css necessary?
	Answer: Certain elements (like h1-h6, p, etc) have pre-defined attribute values (like margins and padding) so when building the style/css, these hidden values can put a wrench in things as you don't realize they're there or you can't figure out exactly what the pre-definitions are (this happened on my blog creation). So zero-ing out the playing field is desired.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	Answer: I use Chrome. Ya....my blogs looked goot on Chrome but not so good in IE. Very bad - standardization brings benefits to everyone (developers and users, but I guess not the companies that make them so here we are). It's like when the US railroad system was being built and different companeis used different track widths - doh.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	Answer: Nopers.
