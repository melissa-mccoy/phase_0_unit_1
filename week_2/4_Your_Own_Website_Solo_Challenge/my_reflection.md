My Website url: http://melissa-mccoy.github.io/ <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
	Answer: I learned a lot about the actual process of developing the design of a webpage in companies and how to better wireframe.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	Answer: Being forced to wireframe, I realized how helpful it is! I was able to plan my content and positioning as well as some color choices. The proportions were a little off on my wireframe and I want to try to better align the wireframe size with my actual screen size in the future.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	Answer:I started with writing out all the HTML in Sublime Text and spending a little time on the CSS (mostly putting in the selectors I thought I'd need) before first viewing it in Chrome. Then, I used mostly Chrome Dev Tools to build the CSS. If I didn't have selector, I would add the styling inline (I couldn't figure out how to add a selector in the CSS in devtools...I guess I could have in the source code) and when I saved the file to my computer, I would go back in sublime and take the styling out of the html and into a CSS selector.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	Answer: I want to add some moving parts like buttons and a search bar with javascript.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	Answer: I spent a lot of time playing around with positioning/trying to understand how to most effectively position elements which resulted in a focus on creating containers that are relatively positioned that I can position things absolutely to.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	Answer: lots but nothing that's worth mentioning.
