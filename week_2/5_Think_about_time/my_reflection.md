# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	Answer: Not pacing myself correctly. I start off going meticoulously through the resources and when I run out of time at the end of the week and push too quickly through the rest.
* How will you combat that? 
	Answer: Learning from experience in how long things take. Planning to finish things significantly earlier than necessary so I have buffer time if I underestimate. Don't go so meticulously through the content until I've finished everything and then review.
* What techniques will you try?
	Answer: all of the above.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	Answer: Work on Phase0 in the evenings after work Mon-Fri and focus full-time on Sat/Sun.
