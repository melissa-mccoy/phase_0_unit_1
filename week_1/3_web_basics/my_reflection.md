1. A DNS server provides a phonebook of Domain Name<-->IP addresses that every computer has to reference. Time Berners-Lee basically created the worldwide web - go Brits!

2. You have to end text files that you wish to serve as website source files with .html extensions. 

3. Sharp burst of Dopamine to my brain!

4. Erm...I was glad that I could commit and push my index.html to GitHub using the terminal without looking at my notes - it's starting to become more intuitive to me.

5. Well - I'm using Linux so don't have the computer app and when I looked at http://melissa-mccoy.github.io, it told me that my repository wasn't set up to show GitHub pages...so I followed these directions (help.github.com/categories/20/articles) and set up my repo with GitHub pages which added some folders with javascript and other pretty things. I don't think I was supposed to make it work this way but the "Tutorial" listed didn't really have any info on this problem (only talked about committing and pushing the file which I had already done). So help.github.com/categories/20/articles is a resource!
