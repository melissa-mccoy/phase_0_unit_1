1) What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
  No problems really... I installed it both on my Windows host computer and on my Ubuntu Virtual Box. I supposed my only confusion is the lack of a Github "app" on Linux (like MacOS and Windows have) - it said that it would explain what to do on Linux later but hasn't yet.

2) Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
  Git is the actual software system that manages version control of files and runs locally on your computer. It can connect to the cloud or online service if you'd like to have online access to your files. GitHub is the online platform that communicates with the Git system on your   computer.

3) Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
Version control is the management of multiple versions of a file that allows consolidation and agreement. GitHub allows file contributors to connect via the net, thus ensuring that contributors can access and add new versions of the file and everyone stays on the same page.
 
4) Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
Firstly, a developer wants to save a record of his or her own work that he or she can refer back to. Secondly, development can be faster when multiple developers are involved and version control allows multiple contributors to work on a file and reconcile these multiple versions together. It does make sense and I wish this existed outside of coding environments like with MS Excel especially. 
 
5) What doesn't make sense? What does?
I'm a little confused on some of the technical steps of using Git and GitHub but not the concept itself. I have written down my questions to ask during a tutoring session. They include:
What happens to a branch if you don't merge it with the master? Do you need to delete it?
Is it possible to create a remote repository on Github through your command screen? Or is it required to first create the remote repo on GitHub.com and then create a path between it and your local computer?
Why doesn't the .git directory show up in my initalized local repo when I type ls but it does when I type ls -la (as seen in a video)?
Where does ../ ver ~/ take you?
How do you push changes to your forked repo online? Is it <<git push upstream>> if you've used <<git remote add upstream [repo url]>>?
What happens if you connect multipl local repos to the same online repo?
