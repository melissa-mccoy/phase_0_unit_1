1. The element and property names are all straighforward/easy to understand. I guess I'm least comfortable with the "best practices" of HTML coding as it appears there's multiple ways to attain the same visual result in HTML but I'm sure there's a "best way" for cross browswer compatibility or other reasones.
2. The logic behind HTML elements and properties is pretty intuitive and there's not much of a learning curve.
3. No big "aha" moments as I've coded in HTML/CSS before.
4. I've been using the book "HTML & CSS: Design and Build Website"  by John Duckett (which I believe the GirlDevelopIt ppts are based on and it conveys info in a nice way (though there's lots of pages for not much content but I guess that's the point.
