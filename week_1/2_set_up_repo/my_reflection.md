1) You can create a repo on GitHub by pressing the "Create New Repository" button - genius! You can clone or copy this repo to your local computer by, in your terminal, navigating to the directory where you'd like to copy the repo and then entering this code into your terminal <<git clone git@github.com:[username]/[repo_name]

2) Open source software is software that the general public can use/modify/sell with only a few restrictions, depending on the type of open source license the software is protected by.

3) Well, I believe humans are inherently self-interested so what the success of the open source movement says to me is that many people value the sense of meaning and/or recognition they get when they contribute to open source projects VERY highly as theyre not receiving any financial compensation. Generally, as the US population becomes more well-off financially (not fighting to put food on the table) the more that were looking for meaning from other sources other than financial success. The Open Source movement is good for society and it doesnt make me nervous though I would think hard on whether I would want to share my own software in this way.

4) Licenses protect your work according to the stipulated guidlines such as ensuring appropriate compensation to creators is madde or ensuring the software is used in an appropriate manner.

5) I didnt realize there were any licenses associate with open source and the provide text was very enlitening.

6) I had trouble with creating the local clone of my GitHub project repo and the issue was that while I had created an SSH key for my Ubuntu VirtualBox I hadnt added it to GitHub so I used this reference to do so: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
