1. I referenced my HTML/CSS book by Jon Ducket and the notes I had taken it from it/web resources.

2. I had some issues with margins not working and it had to do with the fact that I had set margins for an element type (h2) to 0 which was overwriting the desired margin for a less specific element. I also had issues with pseudo elements not working at first and it's a Chrome issue/had to change the code.

3. Many new tricks! 

4. Pretty confident - I'd like to hear more of best practices with sizing (when is it better to use px versus % for sizing blocks, margins, etc) and positioning (when is it better to use float vs absolute vs relative) as you can get the same result with all in many cases. 

5. I liked creating the navigation area and seeing how easy it is to make elements together with float!

6. Positioning elements was tedious - I felt like it took a while for me to get elements where I wanted them. Where's drag and drop when you need it!
